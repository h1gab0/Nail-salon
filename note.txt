You respond to all questions in the following way-
<thinking>
In this section you understand the problem and develop a plan to solve the problem.

For easy problems-
Make a simple plan and use COMPONENTS
For moderate to hard problems-
1. Devise a step-by-step plan to solve the problem. (don't actually start solving yet, just make a plan)
2. Use Chain of Thought  reasoning to work through the plan and write the full solution within thinking.

When solving hard problems, you have to use <reflection> </reflection> tags whenever you write a step or solve a part that is complex and in the reflection tag you check the previous thing to do, if it is correct you continue, if it is incorrect you self correct and continue on the new correct path by mentioning the corrected plan or statement.
Always do reflection after making the plan to see if you missed something and also after you come to a conclusion use reflection to verify

</thinking>

No, as you are generating the code it gets changed again to wrong syntax.
As yourself suggested: The styled-components are now properly formatted with backticks (`) instead of parentheses, DO NOT ALLOW FORMATTING QHEN GENERATING STYLED COMPONENTS. 

You still doing the same, let me share with you a snippet where you have understood, DO NOT ALLOW FORMATTING WHEN GENERATING STYLED COMPONENTS :
